#**What is GitHub?**

  This site was originally intended for use on collaborating on group coding projects, the format is a little obtuse if your not used to it, but once you get the hang of it there are a lot of cool features that should help in working together for this outline. I'll go into detail towards the end, though not necessary I think it helps to understand the original purpose of this site as it give insight into the more nuanced features. I am learning as I go, so if anyone else has any experience or suggestions voice them out!
  
**What are the perks of using GitHub?**

  * One can easily make a copy of this repository to edit without changing the original
  * Edits are chronicled automatically so we can see who made what changes
  * Can easily add other files and folders for other projects 
  * Everyone will be up to date on the status of the group outline and who is tasked with doing what

**What are the downsides to GitHub?**

  * The format may be confusing at first, so if you understand how it works and see someone struggling please help them out!
  * To give everyone access is a bit contrived, but once I make you a collaborator you can add other people too
  * Understanding the UI takes some time, and I will update pictures as I can to illustrate some questions in the FAQ
  * If a group member is not in on the discussion then they will be left out :( if you decide to use this for your group please do everything you can to inform your team!
  

**How can I collaborate with my group here?**

  All you have to do is make an account, and let me know your username so I can add you as a collaborator. It also helps if your group is in on it too, so if you decide to use this it would be benificial to spread the word to the others in your group.
  
**Will this count towards class participation?**

  At this moment, no, the syllabus states under Group Collaborations/Discussion Participation:
  
>Another 45% of your grade will come from participation in small group discussions/collaborations via D2. Generally, I grade on attendance and participation, including participation in the classroom itself, but since this is an online course, all of your participation relates to online discussions of the material. This makes your discussions all the more important, as they are the only way to obtain participation points. For each discussion, I provide supplemental readings tied to course concepts and questions requiring group members to work together applying course concepts to the readings. Each group is required to develop one set of responses to the questions. I will provide the readings and questions with two to three weeks to complete. The participation points will be evenly distributed based on the number of required discussions (e.g., if there are 15 weeks’ worth of discussions, then each week’s discussions are worth 3% of your overall grade). If you never participate in these collaborations, you will receive 0.

This means that we are graded soley on our discussion within D2L. I would reccomend using this as an area to work on the outline and formulate our ideas as a group, then post them to D2L as is appropriate. It is likely our professor will see this though **we cannot assume he has the time to dig through our scribbles on here as well as D2L**. If this were the in-class instead of online class, this would be the table discussion and D2L is final drafted paper (don't forget the audio log!).
  

  
##**_Terms_**

**_Repository_** : Used to identify collaboration projects everything we edit here takes place within it, (e.g. GlobalPolitics is a repository)

**_Fork & Pull Dev Model_** : This model of development is intended for larger groups, where the original repository has a select few collaborators and any interested parties create a fork of the original and edit it as they desire. Then one would submit a pull request to alert others of the changes, and prompt discussion on the edits and/or a collaborator to include the edit in the original.

**_Shared Repository Dev Model_** : This model of development works well with smaller groups, everyone in the group is granted collaborator status which in turn gives you "push" access, meaning you can make changes and push it to the original immediately without waiting for a collaborator. **This is how we will be organizing this**

**_Collaborator_** : Someone who has been given permissions by an existing collaborator on a repository; this give one full access to editing the original repository

**_Forking_** : Making a personal copy of a repository to edit, will not change the original repository. Use this if you are not sure about an edit to the original, or you wish to start your own outline/project off of the original

**_Pulling_** : Used when making a "Pull Request" in the Fork & Pull Dev Model, this is used if you are not a collaborator and wish to show a collaborator an edit you have made that you would like to be represented in the original. Since we should all be collaborators we should not need this, though it may have unforseen functionality (will update when I am more versed!)
